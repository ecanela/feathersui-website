How do I build cross-platform user interfaces with the [Feathers UI](/) framework? Is it easy to set up a development environment? How do I compile for different platforms? What about styling & themes? When should I use the different layout options? Where can I learn about more advanced topics — like creating custom UI components from scratch?

The Feathers UI Screencasts are a collection of **_short_, densely-packed** video tutorials that teach you to be a framework expert — with _zero fluff_.

- See actual commands running in a terminal.
- Watch as code gets written in real-time using a popular editor.
- Know what to expect when code is compiled & launched.

Each bite-sized video is **five minutes or less** — because your time shouldn't be wasted. Every lesson is filled with tons of **actionable knowledge** — to give you a solid foundation for success as a Feathers UI developer.
