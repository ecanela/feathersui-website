The [`ResponsiveGridLayout`](https://api.feathersui.com/current/feathers/layout/ResponsiveGridLayout.html) class positions items in a grid, with a specific number of columns (defaulting to twelve columns). Items may span multiple rows and may be displayed with offsets in between. When a row is "full", items are laid out starting on the next row automatically.
