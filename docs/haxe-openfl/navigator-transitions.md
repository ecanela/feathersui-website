title: Animated transitions for Feathers UI view navigators
sidebar_label: Navigator animated transitions
---

A _transition_ animates two views of a navigator component when it switches between them. Transitions help establish a visual relationship between these two views, such as hierarchy or proximity — providing extra context to improve the user experience. They also provide a bit of personality and polish to your project.

Feathers UI offers a number of classes to quickly create common transition animations. All view navigators support custom transitions too.
